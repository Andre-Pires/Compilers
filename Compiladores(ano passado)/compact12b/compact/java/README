  The Compact in Java is under test and may not work correctly!!!

  The files Compact.* and Interp.java are specific to the compiler,
  although the nodes Print, Read, Variable and Assign are too restrictive
  for use in other more powerfull languages.

  The use of the interpreter is straitforward, after doing 'make':
  $ java -cp Compact.jar Interp ../examples/tri.cpt

  To create i386 executable you must, after doing 'make' here and in the
  '../runtime/' directory:
	Compile:	$ java -cp Compact.jar Compact tri.cpt
	     or:	$ java -jar Compact.jar tri.cpt
	Assemble:	$ nasm -felf tri.asm
	Link:		$ ld -o tri tri.o ../runtime/lib.o ../runtime/linux.o
	and run:	$ ./tri

  To create a Postfix debug version:
  	Compile:	$ java -cp Compact.jar Compact -debug tri.cpt
	Debug:		$ pfd tri.cpt
